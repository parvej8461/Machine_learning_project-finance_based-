# 📈 S&P 500 Daily Return Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project focuses on predicting the **next-day forward returns of the S&P 500 index** using a wide range of **market, macroeconomic, volatility, sentiment, momentum, and pricing indicators**.  
The pipeline is built using **time-series aware machine learning techniques** and is fully production-ready for Kaggle submission and GitHub portfolio showcase.

---

## 🚀 Project Objective

The goal is to build a **robust regression model** that can accurately predict:

- **Daily forward returns of the S&P 500**
- Using historical **technical, macro, sentiment, volatility, and momentum features**
- While avoiding **data leakage and look-ahead bias**

This project is designed for:
- ✅ Kaggle competitions
- ✅ Quant & Trading roles
- ✅ Data Science & Machine Learning interviews
- ✅ Academic and portfolio projects

## 📂 Dataset Description

The dataset consists of **decades of daily market data** with multiple feature categories:

### 🔹 Feature Groups

- `M*`   → Market / Technical Indicators  
- `E*`   → Macroeconomic Features  
- `I*`   → Interest Rate Features  
- `P*`   → Price & Valuation Metrics  
- `V*`   → Volatility Indicators  
- `S*`   → Sentiment Indicators  
- `MOM*` → Momentum Indicators  
- `D*`   → Dummy / Binary Features  

### 🔹 Target & Financial Variables

- `forward_returns` → ✅ **Target variable**

## 🧪 Models Implemented

| Model | Purpose |
|--------|----------|
| Linear Regression | Baseline performance |
| Random Forest Regressor | Non-linear ensemble model |
| XGBoost Regressor | High-performance boosting model |

Final model selection is done using **Walk-Forward Time Series Validation RMSE**.

---

## 🔁 Walk-Forward Time Series Validation

Unlike regular cross-validation, this project uses:

- ✅ `TimeSeriesSplit`
- ✅ Expanding window validation
- ✅ No data shuffling
- ✅ No information leakage from the future

This makes the evaluation **financially realistic and production-safe**.

---

## ⚙️ Feature Engineering

The following advanced features were added to boost predictive performance:

### ✅ Lag Features
Lagged values (T-1, T-2) were created for:
- Market features (`M1`, `M2`)
- Volatility features (`V1`, `V2`)
- Momentum features (`MOM1`, `MOM2`)

### ✅ Rolling Features
- 5-day rolling mean of returns
- 5-day rolling standard deviation (volatility proxy)

These features help the model capture:
- Short-term momentum
- Volatility clustering
- Market regime behavior

## Model Evaluation Strategy

### Primary Metric: RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)

### Secondary Metric: MAE (Mean Absolute Error)

### Final model selected based on Walk-Forward CV performance

## Key Results & Learnings

Lag and rolling features significantly improved performance

XGBoost consistently outperformed linear and bagging models

Time-series validation was critical in avoiding overfitting

Feature importance helped remove noisy signals

The entire pipeline is now production-safe and quant-ready


 Future Improvements

🔹 Ensembling (XGBoost + Random Forest)

🔹 Regime-based models (Bull vs Bear markets)

🔹 Hyperparameter tuning with Bayesian Optimization

🔹 Direct Sharpe Ratio optimization

🔹 Deep learning models (LSTM, Temporal CNN)
